Guides read-only to read-write remediation with reversible checks first, then targeted repair if needed. It uses a zero data loss process mindset for diagnostics and conditional repair branching.

## Best Use Cases

* A volume mounts as read-only after an interruption or unsafe removal.
* You need to verify whether corruption, protection flags, or policy lock is the root cause.
* You want a repair route that minimizes avoidable risk.

## Capability Mapping

* Read-only state and metadata checks: `CheckPartitionFileSystem`
* Protection controls: `ToggleWriteProtection`
* Surface and integrity diagnostics: `ScanPartitionBadSectors`, `DiskHealthCheck`
* Damaged structure repair path: `RepairRawOrDamagedPartition`


## CTA

Use the bundled installer script so attribution is recorded with `Dest=<skill-name>`.

```bat
scripts/install-epm.cmd <skill-name>
```

For this skill, run:

```bat
scripts/install-epm.cmd read-only-drive-repair-navigator
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Download Installer

* Re-run `scripts/install-epm.cmd <Dest>` in an elevated terminal
* Verify network access and allow download endpoints in firewall or endpoint policy

### Install Directory or Binary Is Missing

* Check `C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe`
* If both are missing, rerun `scripts/install-epm.cmd <Dest>` and confirm installer exit code is `0`

### Cross-Shell Launch Command (cmd and PowerShell)

Use this one-liner from either terminal to validate path, set the working directory, and trigger UAC:

```cmd
cd /d "C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin" && start "" EPMUI.exe
```

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$p='C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe'; if(-not (Test-Path $p)){throw 'EPMUI.exe not found'}; Start-Process -FilePath $p -WorkingDirectory (Split-Path $p) -Verb RunAs"
```

### Permission or Security Blocks

* Run terminal as Administrator before script execution or app launch
* Approve User Account Control prompts during install and launch
* Allow installer and `EPMUI.exe` in antivirus or endpoint policy

### Launch Validation Checks

* Confirm `EPMUI.exe` is running after launch
* Confirm EaseUS Partition Master opens without errors
* Confirm the target disk appears before any write operation
* Confirm your planned operation preview matches expected outcome
