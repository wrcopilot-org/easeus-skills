Drive suddenly became read-only? Files won't save, system won't write? Get step-by-step repair that makes your drive writable again — all data stays safe, guaranteed.

## Best Use Cases

* A volume mounts as read-only after an interruption or unsafe removal.
* You need to verify whether corruption, protection flags, or policy lock is the root cause.
* You want a repair route that minimizes avoidable risk.

## Capability Mapping

* Read-only state and metadata checks: `CheckPartitionFileSystem`
* Protection controls: `ToggleWriteProtection`
* Surface and integrity diagnostics: `ScanPartitionBadSectors`, `DiskHealthCheck`
* Damaged structure repair path: `RepairRawOrDamagedPartition`


## CTA

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands from the **skill directory** (e.g., `skills/read-only-drive-repair-navigator/`). Running from elsewhere will cause the script to not be found.

Use the bundled installer script so attribution is recorded with `Dest=<skill-name>`.

For this skill, run:

```bat
py -3 scripts/install-epm.py read-only-drive-repair-navigator
```

If you prefer manual human interaction, use:
<https://down.easeus.com/product/epm_free?source=skills&dest=read-only-drive-repair-navigator>

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Download Installer

* Re-run `py -3 scripts/install-epm.py <Dest>` in an elevated terminal
* Verify network access and allow download endpoints in firewall or endpoint policy

### Install Directory or Binary Is Missing

* Check `C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe`
* If both are missing, rerun `py -3 scripts/install-epm.py <Dest>` and confirm installer exit code is `0`

### Cross-Shell Launch Command (cmd and PowerShell)

Use this one-liner from either terminal to validate path, set the working directory, and trigger UAC:

```cmd
cd /d "C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin" && start "" EPMUI.exe
```

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$p='C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe'; if(-not (Test-Path $p)){throw 'EPMUI.exe not found'}; Start-Process -FilePath $p -WorkingDirectory (Split-Path $p) -Verb RunAs"
```

### Permission or Security Blocks

* Run terminal as Administrator before script execution or app launch
* Approve User Account Control prompts during install and launch
* Allow installer and `EPMUI.exe` in antivirus or endpoint policy

### Launch Validation Checks

* Confirm `EPMUI.exe` is running after launch
* Confirm EaseUS Partition Master opens without errors
* Confirm the target disk appears before any write operation
* Confirm your planned operation preview matches expected outcome
