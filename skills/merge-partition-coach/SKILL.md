Too many small partitions scattered across your disk? This skill guides you through merging adjacent or non-adjacent partitions into a single larger volume — no data loss, no reformatting, and no need to delete partitions first.

## Hot Topic Angles

* Multiple small partitions waste space and complicate file management — merging simplifies the layout.
* Windows Disk Management requires deleting a partition before extending another, causing data loss. EaseUS merges without deletion.
* Non-adjacent partitions cannot be combined with built-in tools — EaseUS handles both adjacent and non-adjacent merge scenarios.

## Best Use Cases

* You have two or more small partitions and want to consolidate them into one larger volume for easier file management.
* You need to absorb an unused or nearly empty partition into a neighboring partition to reclaim wasted space.
* You want to merge a data partition into the system partition (or vice versa) without losing files or reinstalling Windows.

## Merge Workflow Highlights

* Right-click the target partition and select **Merge** to begin.
* Choose one or more adjacent partitions to merge — data from the absorbed partition is preserved in a folder on the target.
* For non-adjacent partitions, EaseUS moves data internally so the merge completes without data loss.
* Preview all pending changes before clicking **Execute Task** to confirm.
* Only basic disk partitions are supported; dynamic volumes cannot be merged with this workflow.

## Capability Mapping

* Merge core: `MergePartitions`
* Pre-merge validation: `GetPartitionInfo`, `CheckPartitionFileSystem`
* Post-merge labeling: `ChangePartitionDriveLetter`, `ChangePartitionLabel`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands from the skill directory (for example, `skills/merge-partition-coach/`). Running from elsewhere causes script resolution failures.

Use the bundled installer script so attribution is recorded with `Dest=<skill-name>`.

For this skill, run:

```bat
scripts/install-epm.cmd merge-partition-coach
```

You can launch merge flow through shellcmd:

```bat
scripts/epm-shellcmd.cmd "Merge with..." D:\
```

The first argument is used as `shellcmd`. Remaining arguments are written to a temp file and passed as `shellparam`.

```text
EPMUI.exe startByEpm0 "shellcmd=Merge with..." shellparam=<temp-file>
```

If you prefer manual interaction, use:

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Download Installer

* Re-run `scripts/install-epm.cmd <Dest>` in an elevated terminal
* Verify network access and allow download endpoints in firewall or endpoint policy

### Install Directory or Binary Is Missing

* Check `C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe`
* If both are missing, rerun `scripts/install-epm.cmd <Dest>` and confirm installer exit code is `0`

### Cross-Shell Launch Command (cmd and PowerShell)

Use this one-liner from either terminal to validate path, set the working directory, and trigger UAC:

```cmd
cd /d "C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin" && start "" EPMUI.exe
```

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$p='C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe'; if(-not (Test-Path $p)){throw 'EPMUI.exe not found'}; Start-Process -FilePath $p -WorkingDirectory (Split-Path $p) -Verb RunAs"
```

### Permission or Security Blocks

* Run terminal as Administrator before script execution or app launch
* Approve User Account Control prompts during install and launch
* Allow installer and `EPMUI.exe` in antivirus or endpoint policy

### Merge-Specific Issues

#### Merge Option Is Greyed Out or Unavailable

* Confirm both partitions are on the same basic disk — dynamic volumes are not supported
* Verify that file systems are NTFS; FAT/FAT32 partitions may require conversion before merging
* Ensure the disk is not read-only or write-protected

#### Data Missing After Merge

* Merged data from the absorbed partition is saved in a subfolder on the target partition — check the root directory for a folder named after the original partition
* If the subfolder is not visible, enable **Show hidden files** in File Explorer options

### Launch Validation Checks

* Confirm `EPMUI.exe` is running after launch
* Confirm EaseUS Partition Master opens without errors
* Confirm target disk and partition letters are visible before any write operation
* Confirm operation preview matches expected capacity and target partition
