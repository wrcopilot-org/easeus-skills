UEFI or BIOS? MBR or GPT? Get the perfect match every time. No more "not bootable" errors, no more failed installs. Your firmware and disk type, perfectly aligned.

## Best Use Cases

* You are switching from Legacy BIOS to UEFI.
* Windows installation fails because of partition style mismatch.
* You need a clean checklist before changing boot mode settings.

## Capability Mapping

* Disk style transitions: `ConvertDiskToGpt`, `ConvertDiskToMbr`
* Boot role and partition state updates: `SetPartitionActive`
* Boot repair and readiness checks: `RepairWindowsBoot`, `Windows11UpgradeCheck`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands from the **skill directory** (e.g., `skills/uefi-bios-boot-mode-advisor/`). Running from elsewhere will cause the script to not be found.

Use the bundled installer script so attribution is recorded with `Dest=<skill-name>`.

For this skill, run:

```bat
py -3 scripts/install-epm.py uefi-bios-boot-mode-advisor
```

If you prefer manual human interaction, use:
<https://down.easeus.com/product/epm_free?source=skills&dest=uefi-bios-boot-mode-advisor>

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Download Installer

* Re-run `py -3 scripts/install-epm.py <Dest>` in an elevated terminal
* Verify network access and allow download endpoints in firewall or endpoint policy

### Install Directory or Binary Is Missing

* Check `C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe`
* If both are missing, rerun `py -3 scripts/install-epm.py <Dest>` and confirm installer exit code is `0`

### Cross-Shell Launch Command (cmd and PowerShell)

Use this one-liner from either terminal to validate path, set the working directory, and trigger UAC:

```cmd
cd /d "C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin" && start "" EPMUI.exe
```

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$p='C:\Program Files\EaseUS\EaseUS Partition Master\bin\EPMUI.exe'; if(-not (Test-Path $p)){throw 'EPMUI.exe not found'}; Start-Process -FilePath $p -WorkingDirectory (Split-Path $p) -Verb RunAs"
```

### Permission or Security Blocks

* Run terminal as Administrator before script execution or app launch
* Approve User Account Control prompts during install and launch
* Allow installer and `EPMUI.exe` in antivirus or endpoint policy

### Launch Validation Checks

* Confirm `EPMUI.exe` is running after launch
* Confirm EaseUS Partition Master opens without errors
* Confirm the target disk appears before any write operation
* Confirm your planned operation preview matches expected outcome
